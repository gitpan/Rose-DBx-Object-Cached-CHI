Revision history for Perl module Rose::DBx::Object::Cached::CHI

    - Sorry for all the updates so close together, actually wrote some more tests.  Found bugs.
    - Check for valid response on setting objects. Thanks David Bourget
    - Some objects were not expiring correctly.  This has been fixed with a call directly to the meta class

    - Since save() ends up calling the insert() or the update() methods we do not need to also implement save()

    - Adding a default_cached_objects_settings class method
